Codebase may contain leftover webhooks/links/etc. that are related to Farweb's database. The database will not be provided, and it is on you to create your own. In addition, certain links were removed prior to this repo's upload that pertained to Farweb's Discord and other such sites. Code may not be functional upon compile and will require some work to make compilable.
